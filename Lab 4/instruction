Lab 4: ELF - introduction
This lab may be done in pairs.

You must complete task 0 before attending the lab, and we also recommend doing tasks 1a, 1b, and 1c before the lab.

Lab Goals
Extracting useful information from files in ELF.
Fixing files using this information: reverse engineering.
In the following labs, you will learn to handle object and executable files. We begin by learning just some of the basics of ELF, together with applications you can already use at this level - editing binary files and writing software patches. Then, we will continue our study of ELF files, by beginning to parse the structures of ELF files, and to use them for various purposes. In particular, we will access the data in the section header table and in the symbol table.
Methodology
Learn how to use the readelf utility. By using readelf you can get, in a human readable format, all the ELF structural information.
Experience basic ELF manipulation.
Recommended Operating Procedure
This advice is relevant for all tasks. Note that while at some point you will no longer be using hexedit to process the file and readelf to get the information, nevertheless in some cases you may still want to use these tools for debugging purposes. In order to take advantage of these tools and make your tasks easier, you should:
Support debugging messages: in particular the offsets of the various items, as you discover them from the headers. Also, whenever the user is required to enter values, you should print the parsed values in their respective representation (e.g. string, decimal or hexadecimal).
Use hexedit and readelf to compare the information you are looking for, especially if you run into unknown problems: hexedit is great if you know the exact location of the item you are looking for.
Note that while the object files you will be processing will be linked using ld, and will, in most cases, use direct system calls in order to make the ELF file simpler, there is no reason why the programs you write need use this interface. You are allowed to use the standard library when building your own C programs.
In order to preserve your sanity, even if the code you MANIPULATE may be without stdlib, we advise that for your OWN CODE you DO use the C standard library! (Yes, this is repeated twice, so that you notice it!)
In order to keep sane in the following labs as well, understand what you are doing and keep track of that and of your code, as you will be using them in future labs.

All the executable files we will work with in this session are 32-Bit ELF binaries.
Compile your code accordingly.

Lab 4 Tasks
Task 0
Task 0a:
Download the executable file abc (from the Lab 4 auxilliary files), and answer the following questions (be prepared to explain your answers to the lab instructor):
Where is the entry point specified, and what is its value?
How many sections are there in "abc"?
Task 0b
Write a program called hexeditplus:
 ./hexeditplus
The hexeditplus program performs operations (read and write) on files and memory. File operations are done on a file file_name as defined below. Each operation is done in units of size bytes, which indicates a unit size, i.e. the number of bytes we want to use as the basic unit in each operation of our program, such as "display memory contents". Size can be either 1, 2 or 4, with 1 as the default.

First, define a menu for the user with a number of predefined functions (as done in Lab 1), to which we will add functions as we go. The program prints the menu, obtains a choice from the user, acts on it, and repeats infinitely. Specifically, the command line:

 ./hexeditplus
Should print:
Choose action:
0-Toggle Debug Mode
1-Set File Name
2-Set Unit Size
3-Load Into Memory
4-Toggle Display Mode
5-Memory Display
6-Save Into File
7-Memory Modify
8-Quit 
For this part, use an array with the above menu names and pointers to appropriate functions that implement each option, using the same menu scheme from lab 1.
At this point implement "Toggle Debug Mode", "Set File Name", "Set Unit Size", and "Quit". All other functions should at this point be stubs that print "Not implemented yet" and return without doing anything else.

Toggle debug mode means turn the debug flag on (if it is currently off, which it is in the initial state), and print "Debug flag now on". If the debug flag is on, this function prints "Debug flag now off", and turns the flag off. When the debug mode is on, you should print the value of the variables: unit_size, file_name, and mem_count, every time just before the menu is printed.

All functions should be of the form:

 void fun(state* s); // Getting the state as a pointer allows the functions to change it.
where the state struct is defined as:


typedef struct {
  char debug_mode;
  char file_name[128];
  int unit_size;
  unsigned char mem_buf[10000];
  size_t mem_count;
  /*
   .
   .
   Any additional fields you deem necessary
  */
} state;
Set File Name queries the user for a file name, and store it in file_name. You may assume that the file name is no longer than 100 characters. If debug mode is on, the function should also print (to stderr, as are all debug messages): "Debug: file name set to 'file_name' " (obviously, replacing 'file_name' with the actual name).

Set Unit Size option sets the size variable. The steps are:

Prompt the user for a number.
If the value is valid (1, 2, or 4), set the size variable accordingly.
If debug mode is on, print "Debug: set size to x", with x the appropriate size.
If not valid, print an error message and leave size unchanged.

Quit is a function that prints "quitting" (in debug mode), and calls exit(0) to quit the program.
The rest of the functions will be written in the next tasks. The menu should be extensible, you will change and extend it in each sub-task of task 1. It should be printed using a loop iterating over the menu array, and be {NULL, NULL} terminated.

Be sure to implement this code and test it carefully before the lab (that is why you have the debug option), as you will need to extend it during the lab!

Task 1: hexeditplus
In this task we will write our own version of hexedit for working with binary files. You will extend your code from task 0b.
Note: You should verify that there is no error when opening a file. In case of an error, you should print a message and abort the rest of the operation.
For this task you will be working with the following ELF file: abc (see Lab 4 auxilliary files).
Note: For any functions that handle files, the file needs to be opened and closed within that function

Task 1a: Load Into Memory
For this task, you may assume that the size of the data being loaded is less than 10000 bytes.
Write the function for the "Load Into Memory" option, which works as follows:

Check if file_name is empty (i.e. equals to ""), and if it is print an error message and return.
Open file_name for reading. If this fails, print an error message and return.
Prompt the user for location in hexadecimal, and length (in decimal).
If debug flag is on, print the file_name, as well as location, and length.
Copy length * unit_size bytes from file_name starting at position location into mem_buf.
Close the file.

Assume that the user has already set the file name to "abc". If the user chooses 3 on the menu, he is prompted for location and length. It should look as follows:
3
Please enter <location> <length>
12F 10
The program should open the file abc and load the 10 bytes (assuming unit size is set to 1), from byte 303 (which is the decimal value of 0x12F) to byte 312 in the file into mem_buf. The output should look like:
Loaded 10 units into memory

Remember
To read location (hexadeciomal) and length (decimal) use fgets and then sscanf, rather than scanf directly.
Note again that location is always entered in hexadecimal representation.


Task 1b: Toggle Display Mode
Write the function for the "Toggle Display Mode" option, which switches between display using a decimal representation, and display using a hexadecimal representation.
Toggle display mode means turn the display flag on and print using a hexadecimal representation, the initial state is off and print using a decimal representation. Print "Display flag now on, hexadecimal representation", and if the display flag is on, this function prints "Display flag now off, decimal representation", and turns the flag off. For exmple, (assume that the display flag is off) entererint option 4 in the menu:

4
Display flag now on, hexadecimal representation
4
Display flag now off, decimal representation
Task 1c: Memory Display
Write the function for the "Memory Display" option:
This option displays u units of size unit_size starting at address addr in memory. Unit_size is already defined in state, but u and addr should be queried from the user by this function. u will be given in decimal and addr in hexadecimal. Entering a value of 0 for addr is a special case, in which the memory to be displayed starts at your mem_buf.
The units should be displayed according to the display flag. If the display flag is on then print using a hexadecimal representation, and if the display flag is off print using a decimal representation.

If the user set the unit size to 2 and loaded a file into memory, then the output should look something like this (remember, we previously loaded 5 pairs of bytes from the file abc, located 303-312):

Choose action:
0-Toggle Debug Mode
1-Set File Name
2-Set Unit Size
3-Load Into Memory
4-Toggle Display Mode 
5-Memory Display 
6-Save Into File
7-Memory Modify

Note that, depending on the chosen unit size, the printed hexadecimal values may differ in order when compared with the output of hexedit. Why is that?


Use your newly implemented functionality (load into memory and memory display) to answer: what is the entry point of your own hexeditplus program? Verify your answer using readelf -h



Implementation note: working with units
You are required to write code that handles data in unit sizes (i.e. not necessarily single bytes). This might confuse you into writing much more code than needed. See below how to handle multiple unit sizes when reading, printing etc. without writing too much code. Relevant to this task is the function print_units, and also see below.
Note that, you can use the following lines to use for printing

		printf(dec_formats[u-1], val);
		printf(hex_formats[u-1], val);

where u is the current unit size and val is the val that we want to print, and with the arrays defined as follows:

		static char* hex_formats[] = {"%#hhx\n", "%#hx\n", "No such unit", "%#x\n"};
		static char* dec_formats[] = {"%#hhd\n", "%#hd\n", "No such unit", "%#d\n"};
	
Task 1d: Save Into File
Write the function for the "Save Into File" option, which works as follows:
This option replaces length units (each of size determined by the current unit size) at target-location of file_name with bytes from the hexeditplus memory starting at virtual address source-address. Note that the filename is the last file name set by option 1 "Set File Name".

When the user chooses option 6, the program should query the user for:
source-address (source virtual memory address, in hexadecimal), source-address can be set to 0, in which case, the source address is start of mem_buf, in any other case, use source-address as an address in (virtual) memory.
target-location (target file offset, in hexadecimal),
length (number of units, in decimal).

Implement the checks that the file can be opened (for writing and NOT truncating), and print appropriate debug messages in debug mode as in the previous task. Close the file after writing.
For example, after the file name was set to "abc" and unit size to 1 bytes, choosing option "6-Save Into File" using source-address 960c170, target-location 33 and length 4, the program should write length = 4 bytes from (virtual) memory, starting at address 0x960c170 to the file abc, starting from offset 0x33 (overwriting what was originally there). It should look as follows:

6
Please enter <source-address> <target-location> <length>
960c170 33 4
Note again that the target file is the one specified using option 1 in the menu.

Also observe that after you execute this option, only length units of the file file_name should be changed.

If <target-location> is greater than the size of <file_name> you should print an error message and not copy anything.
You should use hexedit, to verify that your code for tasks 1c and 1d works correctly, by loading a portion of a file into memory and saving it to another file.
Here is some of hexedit's output for the file abc, verify that you understand why the output is as it is.

Task 1e: Memory Modify
Write the function for the "Memory Modify" option:
This option replaces a unit at location in the memory buffer (not virtual memory address!) with val.
The steps are:
Prompt the user for location and val (all in hexadecimal).
If debug mode is on, print the location and val given by the user.
Replace a unit at location in the memory with the value given by val.


When the user chooses option 7, the program should query the user for:
location (memory buffer location, in hexadecimal)
val (new value, in hexadecimal)

For example, if unit size was set to 4, choosing option "7-Memory Modify" using location 0x40, val 0x804808a, will overwrite the 4 bytes starting at location 0x40, with the new value 804808a. It should look as follows:
7
Please enter <location> <val>
40 804808a

As in the previous task, you should check that the location chosen to be modified, given the currentunit size, is valid, and act accordingly.
You can test the correctness of your code using hexedit (by saving the memory buffer to a file and then looking at the resulting change using hexedit).

Task 2: Reading ELF
Download the following file: deep_thought from Lab 4 Files.

deep_thought is an executable ELF file. It does not run as expected. Your task is to understand the reason for that.

Do the following:

Run the file.
Which function precedes main in execution ? (Hint: see assembly code in Lab 3).
What is the virtual address to which this function is loaded (Hint: use readelf -s)
Fixing the buggy executable file
Use your hexeditplus program from task 1 to display the entry point of a file.
What are the values of location/length? How do you know that?

Use the edit functions from hexeditplus program to fix the deep_thought file, so that it behaves as expected.

Task 3: Delving Deeper into the ELF Structure
The goal of this task is to display the compiled code (in bytes) of the function main, in the offensive executable in the lab 4 auxiliary files.
In order to do that, you need to:

find the offset (file location) of the function main.
find the size of the function main.
use your hexeditplus program to display the content of that function on the screen.

Finding the needed information:


Find the entry for the function main in the symbol table of the ELF executable (readelf -s).
In that reference you will find both the size of the function and the function's virtual address and section number.
In the section table of the executable, find the entry for the function's section (readelf -S).
Find both the section's virtual address (Addr), and the section's file offset (Off).
Use the above information to find the file offset of the function.
Hacking the executable file
Hack this executable file so that it does nothing when it is run: replace the code of the main function by NOP instructions.
Make sure you do NOT override the ret instruction (Opcode: c3) in main.
Alternately, you can plant just one ret instruction (where?).
Task 4: Hacking: installing a patch using hexeditplus
The following file ntsc file was meant to be a digit counter. Download it from Lab 4 Files, and run it in the command-line.
 ./ntsc aabbaba123baacca
 ./ntsc 1112111
What is the problem with the file? (hint, try this string: 0123456789)

Create a new program with a correct digit counter function (should get a char* and return an int), compile and test it. Remember to compile with the -m32 flag in order to produce an ELF compatible with 32 bits, and also must use the compile flags: `-fno-pie' and '-fno-stack-protector`

Use hexeditplus to replace (patch) the buggy digit_cnt function in the ntsc file with the corrected version from the new program.
You should do it using options 3 & 6 in hexeditplus.
(think: are there any kinds of restrictions on the code you wrote for the digit_cnt function?)
Explain how you did it, and show that it works.


Deliverables:
Tasks 1,2, and 3 must be completed during the regular lab. Task 4 may be done in a completion lab, but only if you run out of time during the regular lab. The deliverables must be submitted until the end of the lab session.
You must submit source files for task 1 and task 4 and a makefile that compiles them. The source files must be named task1.c, task4.c, and makefile.
Submission instructions
Create a zip file with the relevant files (only).
Upload zip file to the submission system.
Download the zip file from the submission system and extract its content to an empty folder.
Compile and test the code to make sure that it still works.
